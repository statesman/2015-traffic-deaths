      "description":"<p>Stephen Edward Horn was driving westbound in the 800 block of W. Slaughter Lane when his Jeep Grand Cherokee suddenly drove off the road, police said. The vehicle went down a concrete embankment and stopped in an empty field. He was taken to <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com\">South Austin Medical Center</a>, where he was pronounced dead that same day. Police initially thought the crash was caused by a medical issue, but Travis County medical examiners office ruled that Horn's death was not medical in nature. </p>"
